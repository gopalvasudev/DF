# Discussion on CRISIL - housemaids project
How to cover the baseline
What do we really want out of this project? 

The baseline is covered for both the team and DF if we get 200 housemaids to sign up with us as subscribers. Then the pilot should be judged a success. We should use this pilot for the following reasons for ourselves. 

* Find out how the housemaids want to use our product. This is important for approaching other groups as well. For instance, RG found in her last interaction that the maids are interested in convenience. Then RG went on to find out what they are doing that we could help them do more conveniently. 
* Create and test a channel for approaching CHS. 
* Develop the bill payment product. Electricity bill, BEST pass, train pass, mobile, DTH. These are all monthly or quarterly passes and payments. When fully developed we can integrate this into the regular product. 
* Create the collateral materials that we anyway require for our product. 
* Create the training materials for different products and services. This will be very useful for us moving forward.
* Use the CRISIL team to develop our social media presence. 

Here is what we need to offer CRISIL and the volunteers. 

* A baseline of 100 housemaids who have signed up in the first month just through us. They have to be housemaids that work in the CHS that we have given them a list of, or other CHS in the Jogeshwari area. This secures the success of the project for the team. 
* Talk to their CHS contacts and see if the channel can be set up. They are keen to use their contacts to set up the channel. 
* Offer a volunteering channel. Training is the best. The problem is that weekends are the busiest for the housemaids, and the volunteers are mainly available on weekends.
